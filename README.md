# belly-button-challenge


This [Interactive deployment dashboard ](https://janicesara.github.io/belly-button-challenge/) can be used to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
